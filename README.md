### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently a Cloud Engineer at Woven by Toyota, where I lead the technical integration for acquisitions, architect internal tooling, and optimize AWS cloud spend. Previously, I built scalable, complex systems at Viasat, specializing in cloud-native applications and infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m passionate about cloud architecture, autonomous vehicles, and FinOps. Recently, I spearheaded initiatives that saved over $4 million in AWS costs.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on projects related to blockchain, AI/ML for anomaly detection, and autonomous vehicle technology.
- 💬 Ask me about cloud architecture, my adventures with autonomous vehicles, or the best hiking trails in Arizona! 
- ✍️ I also write about my travels, life stories, and project posts on my [personal blog](https://blog.derbique.us). Feel free to check it out!
